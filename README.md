# Basic Commands Configurable
* Basicly, this plugin will help some server owners to add links he want and adds a welcome message. It is very very very simple, i did it for newer peoples on server configuration/sourcemod.

* You can put the links you want in translations folder, change colors and messages.
The plugin will generate a cfg file with the cvar to enable/disable welcome message. 0 = disable / 1 = enable

* Commands: all basics the servers need: **!group**, **!discord**, **!website**, **!ip** and **!owner**. I've made some variables like **!site**, **!serverip**, **!steamgroup**, **!steam**, **etc**.  

**You can request anything here.**

Below here is just explaining about why i decided to do this, you dont need read if you dont want.


PLUGIN PURPOSE: i know this is very basic, but when i started to configure my server, I didn't even know how to do these commands/plugins. I searched, but i not find anything about. Some days ago, a friend who im helping setup his server was asked me about this. He said he cant find anywhere, so i decided to make this plugin.
Maybe it's so easy to do that people don't even think about it?

Whatever, i hope i can help someone. :)
