### PLUGIN PURPOSE 
**Below here is just explaining about why i decided to do this, you dont need read if you dont want.**  

I know this is very basic, but when i started to configure my server, I didn't even know how to do these commands/plugins. I searched, but i not find anything about. Some days ago, a friend who im helping setup his server was asked me about this. He said he cant find anywhere, so i decided to make this plugin.
Maybe it's so easy to do that people don't even think about it?

Whatever, i hope i can help someone. :)
